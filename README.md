## Loss function:

We need a custom loss function to train this ResUNet.So,  we have used the loss function as it is from https://github.com/nabsabraham/focal-tversky-unet/blob/master/losses.py


NOW YOU KNOW HOW TO APPLY AI TO DETECT AND LOCALIZE BRAIN TUMORS. THIS IS A GREAT ACHIEVEMENT IN HEALTHCARE.
